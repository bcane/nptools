# nptools

Illicit automations for neopets. Run in selenium.

## Features

- Daemon that you can just configure, run, and forget about
- Dailies

## TODO Features
- including difficult dailes Food Club (using max TER) and multi-dailies like underwater fishing
- Plays certain games very well. e.g. Shapeshifter, Fetch, Tyranu Evavu
- Restocks and prices items automatically ($$$)
- Logs certain results (e.g. lab zaps)
- Will probably get you frozen

## Quick start

Put

```
NP_USER='username'
NP_PASS='password'
PET_NAME='xX_bestpet_Xx'
```

in a file called .env in this directory. Then run `./run_daemon.sh`.

Additional flags include `USER_AGENT` and `FIREFOX_COOKIES_DB`.

A lot of this code was written with assumptions that only hold true on my
account. So run it at your own risk and maybe start the daemon with only a few
safe dailies enabled first. (Comment out most of the tasks in daemon.py)

## Produced files

### Basic
```
g.pickle: pickle of some state we want to persist (see `lib/g.py`).
nptools.cookies: cookies from selenium broswer output by pickle.
```
### Advance
```
*.log: various activity-specific log files. e.g. lab_ray.log tracks zap results.
pages/: copies of all requested pages.
shop_captchas/: images of captchas when buying items.
```
## Directory structure
